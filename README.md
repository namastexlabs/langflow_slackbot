## How It Works

The Slack AI Assistant leverages a combination of cutting-edge technologies to deliver its intelligent features:

B -- Responses --> A
```

1. The assistant listens for events in your Slack workspace, such as direct messages, mentions, and trigger words.
2. When an event is detected, the assistant processes the input and sends a request to the appropriate AI model (GPT for conversation, DALL-E for image generation, or Speech-to-Text for audio transcription) via the OpenAI API.
3. The AI model generates a response based on the input and sends it back to the Slack AI Assistant.
4. The assistant formats the response and sends it back to the user in Slack.

This seamless integration of Slack and OpenAI's powerful language models enables the Slack AI Assistant to provide intelligent, context-aware responses in real-time.
